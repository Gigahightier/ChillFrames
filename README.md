DailyDuty is a XivLauncher/Dalamud plugin.

DailyDuty allows you to easily and automatically track various daily and weekly tasks.
DailyDuty is designed for people that need _**constant reminders**_ to do things or else they will entirely forget to do them.

The goal of this plugin is to allow you to more easily and more passively complete tasks that reward weekly or daily bonuses.

This plugin is still in early development and many features are currently missing.
Currently the Configuration Window shows **all** planned modules, if it is not included then it is not planned to be added.

A wiki is planned for this plugin but will take time to implement, currently DailyDuty has many features, and several more are planned.

DailyDuty will **not** track anything to do with Retainers or Free Companies, for that use `Accountant` by `Ottermandias`

## Configuration Window

The configuration window can be used to enable, disable, and view the status of each module.

Every module has a status readout that displays the currently tracked status of each module.

Occasionally Daily Duty may be incorrect and requires adjusting.

In the Configuration tab you can enable `Temporary Edit Mode` to correct this data.

## Notifications

DailyDuty uses chat messages to notify you of tasks that are able to be completed.

You will not see notifications for tasks that aren't yet available to be completed, such as Fashion Report, until there is something that you the user are able to do.

DailyDuty also includes clickable `action-links` that can help with managing tasks more easily. These `action-links` have their text colored blue for ease of identification, simply click on the text in your chat window to trigger the action.

One such example is clicking on a "Wondrous Tails" action-link will open the Wondrous Tails book.

Some action-links use the plugin `Teleporter` to teleport you to where that task can be complete.

**All chat messages can only been seen by you, Dalamud Plugins are client side only**
